    the Shadow</h3>

      <p>A dog, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his
    mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another
    Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go
    of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece
    from him.</p>
    <div class="moral"><p> He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water,
    because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.</p></div>

<h3>The Wolf & The Lamb</h3>

<div class="text"><p>Wolf, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay
violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the
Wolf’s right to eat him. He thus addressed him: “Sirrah, last year you
grossly insulted me.” “Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone
of voice, “I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf, “You feed in my
pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted
grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.” “No,” exclaimed the
Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both food
and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
“Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my
imputations.” </p></div>
<div class="moral"><p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p></div>

<h3> <b>The Man and the Lion</b></h3>

<p>

A man and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began
to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and
prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone,
which represented “a Lion strangled by a Man.” The traveler pointed to
it and said: “See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even
the king of beasts.” The Lion replied: “This statue was made by one of
you men. If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man
placed under the paw of the Lion.”</p>

<p>One story is good, till another is told.</p>
